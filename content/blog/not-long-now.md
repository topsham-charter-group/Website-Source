Not long now until Town Charter Day 2019 (24th August if you've forgotten)! It starts with the Annual Town Criers Competition at 10:45am at The Globe. The afternoon celebration when we remember that Topsham was granted its Charter in 1300, begins with a street procession from Matthews Hall at 2pm. Please put on your costumes and join us! There is the promise of an sing-song at the end.

Loiter at St Margaret's Church and meet the donkeys or watch the Punch and Judy. You may even like an ice-cream in the ice-cream parlor. Wander through the street market in Fore Street, enjoy the Mummers play (see program at the bottom for timings) to the Quay where children can learn circus skills, play games or have their faces painted. Refer to the program for all that is happening that afternoon.

Stay for the evening because at 6:30 you can learn how to Charleston on the Quay followed by an relaxing time listening to the band Jelly Roll.

The Charter Day Group would like to thank all those who made bunting. This is now flying above Fore Street and in other places. We can now boast that Topsham now has its own individual bunting which will be used every year! Thank You!
